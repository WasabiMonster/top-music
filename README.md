# Top Music
Sample application that loads the top 100 albums on iTunes and provides details for each one.

# An example of the MVVM-C Coordinator pattern
This architecture is useful for an application that scales and has seperation of concerns without being over-engineered.

# Highlights include:
- Fetching and activity Indicators
- Thumbnail fade-in with a cache to prevent excessive network calls
- An extensible API Manager that is ready to expand to multiple endpoints and handle dynamic parameters per environment
- Custom color and font extensions for easy branding and design iteration
- Environment class setup for additional staging and dev environments if needed in the future

This project is a work in progress.
